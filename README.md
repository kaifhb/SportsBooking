**College ID:** IEC2021046

## Project Overview

This is a web application that allows users to book sports courts at different facilities, check available times, and manage their bookings. The application includes a frontend built with React and Vite for an easy-to-use interface, and a backend developed with Express.js and MongoDB for secure and efficient data management.

## Live Demo

You can access live versions of the frontend and backend applications through these links:

- **Frontend:** [Live Frontend](https://sports-booking-frontend.vercel.app)
- **Backend:** [Live Backend](https://game-theory-backend.onrender.com)

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration using JWT tokens.
- **Real-time Booking System:** Users can view and book available sports court slots.
- **Responsive Design:** The UI adjusts to different screen sizes for a better experience.
- **Data Security:** Sensitive information is managed with environment variables and secure connections.

## Project Structure

### Backend

The backend manages all API requests, user authentication, and database interactions.

- **config/**: Configuration files, including database connections.
- **controller/**: Logic for API routes, managing authentication and bookings.
- **model/**: MongoDB schemas for users, bookings, and court information.
- **routes/**: Definitions for all API routes.
- **middleware/**: Custom middleware, such as authentication checks.

### Frontend

The frontend is created using React and Vite for quick development.

- **src/**: Source files for the frontend.
  - **Components/**: Reusable components like buttons and forms.
  - **Pages/**: Application pages, including login, booking, and sports court displays.
  - **utils/**: Helper functions for managing dates, authentication, etc.
- **App.jsx**: The main component that manages routing and page display.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js:** Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
- **npm:** Comes with Node.js for package management.
- **Git:** For version control (optional but recommended).

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GameTheory.git
   cd GameTheory
   ```

2. **Install Backend Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd Backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Frontend Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

To run the application on your local machine:

1. **Start the Backend:**

   ```bash
   cd Backend
   npm start
   ```

   The backend API will run at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

2. **Start the Frontend:**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Deployment

The application is deployed using Vercel for the frontend and Render.com for the backend.

### Frontend Deployment

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel.
2. Set up your environment variables in Vercel’s dashboard.
3. Deploy the application with automated builds.

### Backend Deployment

1. Use Render to deploy the backend as a web service.
2. Configure necessary environment variables like `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, and `PORT` in the Render dashboard.

## Assumptions and Limitations

- **Authentication:** JWT tokens are stored securely on the client side.
- **Slot Availability:** The system fetches real-time data for available slots from the backend.
- **Date Range:** The system currently supports bookings within a 7-day window.

## Dependencies

### Frontend:

- React
- Chakra UI
- React Router DOM

### Backend:

- Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- JWT for authentication
- bcryptjs for password hashing

## Special Instructions

- **Environment Variables:** Ensure that all sensitive information, like JWT secrets and database URIs, is stored securely.
- **Styling Conflicts:** Use only Chakra UI or CSS-in-JS to avoid issues with other styling libraries.
